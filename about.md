The OpenLoco project started in early 2018. Brought by the same group of people behind [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.io), we are making a modern, open source version of the classic transport simulation game *Chris Sawyerâ€™s Locomotion* by reimplementing the game fully in C++. Currently, the coding efforts are about 60% completed. For the other 40%, we rely on the original *Locomotion* binary.
